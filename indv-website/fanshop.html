        <h2>Online Shop</h2>

        <p>
            This site is mostly about the theories, but thereis also an area of the site dedicated to selling collectibles, clothing, and other items. It is incredibly important for all fans to be able to express their interest in a certain piece of media. For this reason the online shop portion of the site is vital (it would help me to bring in some extra money as well which is ideal). The shop will be broken up into a few different areas. One will be focused on collectibles such as toys, comics, statues, replicas, etc. These such items will mostly be provided by other companies and sold through this site as a third party. The next area will be focused on clothing and other apparel. Most of the products in this category will be products designed by the team at out site and manufactured by a factory somewhere else. Here fans will be able to find T-shirts, sweatshirts, and other clothing items that depict their favorite characters and posters from the series they follow. Overall, the purpose of this area of the site is to provide fans the opportunity to express their interest in their favorite series.
