    Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved the Star Wars movies.  My dad raised me as a fan and we have always collected Star Wars memorabilia and enjoyed discussing the films.  As a result, I’ve thought it would be interesting to make FanTheories.com, a website that really focuses on the fans.  I want all fans to have the opportunity to share their thoughts about whatever movie, TV Show, book, or video game they are interested in and have an opinion about.<br> 
	For example, the thing that comes to my mind is a current topic of discussion surrounding the newest Star Wars movies: “Who is Supreme Leader Snoke?”  There are a ton of theories out there that fans have come up with that I feel should be addressed.  I just think it would be cool for all of these theories to be organized into one place.  Not just that, but that some of the less-heard of, yet equally compelling theories, will receive similar attention and recognition by other fans of the franchise.
