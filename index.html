        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved the Star Wars movies. My dad raised me as a fan and we have always collected Star Wars memorabilia and enjoyed discussing the films. As a result, I’ve thought it would be interesting to make FanTheories.com, a website that really focuses on the fans. I want all fans to have the opportunity to share their thoughts about whatever movie, TV Show, book, or video game they are interested in and have an opinion about.<br> For example, the thing that comes to my mind is a current topic of discussion surrounding the newest Star Wars movies: “Who is Supreme Leader Snoke?” There are a ton of theories out there that fans have come up with that I feel should be addressed. I just think it would be cool for all of these theories to be organized into one place. Not just that, but that some of the less-heard of, yet equally compelling theories, will receive similar attention and recognition by other fans of the franchise.</p>
